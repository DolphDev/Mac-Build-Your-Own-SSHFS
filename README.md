# Mac-Build-Your-Own-SSHFS
This repo will contain code that will allow mac users to build their own copy of sshfs (Without relying on good samitarians to package it further)

# Licence Note

All Code not made in this repo carries their original licence

# Requirements

1. Install [MacFuse ](https://osxfuse.github.io/)

2. `brew install meson ninja glib`

4. TODO THE REST

# Notes you likely will need to rebuild between major updates between mac os, or potentially macfuse
